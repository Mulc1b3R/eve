# Code.

Here is the original code that i used in the developement of Zendog-eve :
```
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"                                          //api key

const baseURL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech";                   // base url ( notice that "create" is not at the end of the path , the /create is added as part of the api request.

const speechFilePath = path.join(__dirname, './output/speech2.mp3');      //output file path.

async function main() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(baseURL, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${api_key}`,
                'Accept-Encoding': 'identity'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                model: "tts-1",                                                       // the open ai model used.
                voice: "fable",                                                 // the open ai voice selected. (fable is an English accent that sounds a bit like Harry Potter).
                prompt: "Turn text into audio mp3 file.",
                input: "This is the input text for speech generation."           // this is the text input field , the text in this field is transformed into an mp3.
            })                                                                   // A txt input area is required by the UI for the user to input txt by typing or pasting.   
        });

        const buffer = await response.buffer();
        fs.writeFileSync(speechFilePath, buffer);

        console.log('Speech file saved successfully. Your mp3 is in the output folder. Have a great day!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

main();
```



## Voices.

As the documentation lacks specific descriptions for each voice, I consulted ChatGPT, via <a href="https://zendog.vercel.app/">Zendog-UI</a>, to provide informed assessments based on their speech:

- Alloy: A versatile voice potentially appropriate for technical or instructional content like tutorials, educational material, or any material necessitating clarity and precision.

- Echo: Suited for storytelling, audiobooks, or content requiring a dramatic or narrative tone.

- Fable: Well-suited for children's stories, fantasy content, or any narrative demanding a playful or imaginative flair.

- Onyx: Recommended for reading serious literature, delivering news content, or any material needing a serious or formal delivery.

- Nova: Ideal for advertisements, motivational content, or materials requiring a positive and enthusiastic tone.

- Shimmer: Appropriate for lifestyle content, podcasts, or any content necessitating an engaging, friendly, and welcoming delivery.
